# IS 2545 - Software Quality Assurance
Fall Semester 2016

DUE 15 Dec 2016

## Deliverable 6

For this assignment, you or a group of you and 1 or 2 of your classmates have been made Directors of Quality for a web application of your choice.  You will develop an entire testing strategy for that web application.  This testing strategy should cover all aspects of testing that we have covered.  It should show that you have thought deeply about the particular concerns of a specific company.

Possible ideas: Amazon, reddit, Facebook, Twitter.  _Please feel free to email me to ask my thoughts on any particular web application._

You will then give a presentation on 15 Dec (the last day of class) of approximately 10 minutes in length.  That presentation should include:

1. A brief overview of the site and what it does
2. Areas of concern and priority (e.g., security is extremely important for a bank versus a social networking site)
3. Testing strategies, e.g.:
   1. What kinds of tests should you have?
   2. What percentage of time/effort should be allocated to each?
   3. Should you bring in outside help to test?
   4. What kind of management structure should you use?
   5. What recommendations would you give to help increase quality?

This paper should be approximately 8 pages in length (double-spaced).

## Format
Every assignment should have a title page with:
* The name of the students in the group
* The title "IS 2545 - DELIVERABLE 6: Test Strategy for *name of site*"

## Notes

You should do independent research to determine general information about the company and web application (e.g. how many users do they have?  how many daily?  have there been previous large quality or security failures?  what infrastructure do they use?)  However, some companies can be very secretive.  You may make up specifics if you cannot find that information (e.g., you can't find  what language the Twitter back-end is written in).  IF YOU DO INCLUDE ANY MADE-UP FACTS, YOU MUST INDICATE IT IN THE PAPER (not in the presentation).

## Grading
