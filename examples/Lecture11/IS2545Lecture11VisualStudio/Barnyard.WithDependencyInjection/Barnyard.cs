         * constructor. Now when we test this class, instead of testing with real animals, we can test with fake animals. Imagine if instead of
         * animals, the objects were things like database connections or API interfaces. We could design a fake database connection that returns
         * default values for our tests. We've now isolated our test to only test the method under test and there is no way for the test to fail
         * except for a bug in the method under test. See IS2545Lecture11VisualStudio.WithDependencyInjection.Tests for examples on how to mock
         * objects.
